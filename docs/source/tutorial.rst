Tutorial
========

At the root of the MARVELsim repository two scripts called ``marvelsim.py`` and ``rv-generator.py`` are made availble for the user. The former is the main script we will use to simulate the MARVEL spectra. We will in the following distinguish between the usage of the **science mode** and **calibration mode** of this software. Intuitively the science mode should be used when simulating a Radial Velocity (RV) time series for which a cross-dispersion displacement in the simulated spectra is generated by the presence of an exoplanet orbiting its stellar host. We will ellaborate on how to perform such simulations in the following, but notice that the ``rv-generator.py`` is a small generic script to generate the RV time series as input for ``marvelsim.py``. The calibration mode of ``marvelsim.py`` is also known as *afternoon calibrations* as these calibrated spectral images are usually conducted during the afternoon prior to the nightly observations. We start explaining the generation of calibration spectra, then object spectra, and lastly how to generate RV time series.

.. attention::

   Note that while working in a python prompt/environment, Pyxel currently has a bug for overwriting the output file directory stated in the input YAML file. This means that the user needs to manually specify the output path within ``MARVELsim/inputfiles/inputfile_marvel.yaml`` (see ``exposure:outputs:output_folder``). Otherwise the default ``MARVELsim/output`` folder will be used.

Calibration mode
----------------

The script ``marvelsim.py`` makes it very easy to produce a batch of calibration data similar to what in the future will be produced in the afternoon, so-called afternoon calibrations. A batch of calibrated data consist of:

  - 10 bias images
  - 5 spectral flats (fiber 1-5)
  - 5 ThAr arc spectra (fiber 1-5)
  - 5 ThNe arc spectra (fiber 1-5)
  - 5 Etalon (fiber 1) + ThAr (fiber 2-5)

To acquire an overview of the module simply use:

.. code-block:: shell

   python marvelsim.py -h

The calibrated data are simply generated by adding the calibration flag and parsing the output directory to the simulator: 

.. code-block:: shell

   python marvelsim.py --calibs -o </path/to/output/>

As seen in the help-function printed to bash, you can easily alter the number of exposures and exposure time for each type of calibrated data. 

   
Science mode
------------

Like the calibration mode of ``marvelsim.py``, the science mode is likewise very user frindly. In the following we show two usage examples simulating a single spectrum of a Sun-like star, with and without a RV signal:

.. code-block:: shell

   python marvelsim.py --time 300 --mag 10.0 --teff 5800 --logg 4.5 --z 0.0 --alpha 0.0 -o </path/to/outdir>
   python marvelsim.py --time 300 --mag 10.0 --teff 5800 --logg 4.5 --z 0.0 --alpha 0.0 --rv 5.5 -o </path/to/outdir>

   For more explicit examples on how to use either PyEchelle and Pyxel independently, have a look at the section :ref:`extra examples <extra examples>`.


RV time series
--------------
   
Within the base of the MARVELsim repository a script to generate noise-less RV amplitude time series exists. Again to get an overview of the parsed arguments simply type:

.. code-block:: shell

   python rv-generator.py -h

This small utility explores the python library `RadVel <https://radvel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ for calculating the true anomaly for a given set of input time point over the observed duration. The modelling of the RV time series are then calculated using the expression for the observed RV signal (Eq. 65) given by `Murray & Correria (2010) <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1009.1738.pdf>`_. Seen in the figure below, we here show an example of generating the RV time series for a single Earth-like planet with a short circular and eccentric orbital period, respectively:  

.. code-block:: shell

   python rv-generator.py -tdur 50 -rs 1 -ms 1 -rp 1 -mp 1 -t0 0 -p 10 -i 90 -w 90 -e 0.0
   python rv-generator.py -tdur 50 -rs 1 -ms 1 -rp 1 -mp 1 -t0 0 -p 10 -i 90 -w 90 -e 0.5

.. image:: rv_model_eccentric.png
   :align: center
   :width: 800

.. admonition:: Note

   Notice that the current version of ``rv-generator.py`` simply schedule an observation for each consecutive night separted exactly one day apart. In the future it will be possible to select the observational compaign through tighter constraints.
	   
The script can also create models of multi-planet systems. As an example we here show how to model the K6V spectral type star `TOI-1260 <https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/505/4/4684/6280967>`_ hosting two (transiting) mini-Neptunes on (assumed) circular orbits:

.. code-block:: shell

   python rv-generator.py -tdur 50 -rs 0.67 -ms 0.69 -rp 2.33 2.82 -mp 8.6 11.8 -t0 10 20 -p 3.13 7.49 -i 90 90 -w 0 90 -e 0 0

.. attention::

   Be warned that the current multi-planet model is very simplistic and do not take into account of the gravitational interactions between the planets. Indeed such interactions perturbes the reflex motion of the stellar host.
